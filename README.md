# FinTech-Portfolio-Analysis

This project involves creating an analysis tool to evaluate and visualize the performance metrics of various investment portfolios, including algorithmic trading strategies, famous "whale" investors, and the S&P 500 Index. The goal is to determine which portfolio outperforms the others across multiple areas: volatility, returns, risk, and Sharpe ratios. Additionally, a custom portfolio of stocks is created and compared against these portfolios.
